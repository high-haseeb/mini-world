# Mini-World

This is a procedurally genearted sandbox world where you can experiment with fire and water. Made in Next.js 14, with Three.js and WebGL.

TODO:
make a map that keeps the state of fires and rains and updates based on fires and rains. we may want to use the three channels for this.
r: fire
g: tree
b: rain
when we add a rain on a fire, it fades out, and when it becomes below a threshold, it ends.
when we add a rain the map becomes green and a trees grows there.
when we add a fire, the trees fades out and ends. might want to make a burning animation for that.
